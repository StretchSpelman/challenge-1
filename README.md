# <Challenge-1>

## Description
- For this project I was tasked to go into the code of a website and to edit, adjust, or add code where needed to keep or improve functionability of the webpage without changing the appearance.
- My motivation for this project was so I can be able to understand code easier and push myself to solve problems on my own without outside help other than classmates.
- The reason I built and edited this assignment was because some of the links and code was not correct and needed to be adjusted.
- This project solves the problems of hyperlinks not going anywhere, there being no alt's for the images, as well as giving the webpage a better title other than just the company's name.
- During this project I learned how to problem solve on my own by using resources such as google and comparing code with other code I already had to see why something did or did not work.
